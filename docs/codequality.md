# Code Quality

### Programmer Oversight
While high code quality standards and practices (like reviews, static analysis, and clear coding guidelines) can make it easier to spot potential oversights during development, they cannot entirely eliminate human error. Well-written and maintainable code makes it easier for developers (including the original author and others) to understand and identify mistakes later on, potentially mitigating the impact of initial oversights [3, p. 842]. However, even with high code quality, a programmer might still miss a subtle bug or a flawed design.

### Postponement of problem resolution
Well-written and maintainable code makes it easier for developers to understand, diagnose, and fix problems quickly. This reduces the perceived difficulty of problem resolution, making postponement less likely.

### Lack of application of design principles
High code quality inherently relies on the application of good design principles. Focusing on code quality encourages developers to write code that is clean, modular, and maintainable, which are direct outcomes of applying design principles.

### Lack of awareness of design smells and refactoring
A focus on maintaining high code quality naturally leads to an awareness of "smells" (indicators of low quality) and the need for refactoring to improve it. Developers striving for quality will learn to identify and address these issues proactively.
