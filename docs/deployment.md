# Ease of deploying changes to production

### Deadline
If deployment is quick, reliable, and straightforward, the "last mile" crunch of release day is minimized. This reduces the incentive to rush or introduce technical debt simply to meet a deployment deadline.

### Schedule pressure
An easy and reliable deployment process significantly reduces the risk and time spent on releases, directly alleviating end-of-cycle schedule pressure and the need to cut corners.

### Postponement of problem resolution
If deploying fixes is quick and easy, there is less overhead or perceived risk in applying resolutions promptly, encouraging timely bug fixes and refactorings.
