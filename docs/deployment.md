# Ease of deploying changes to production

### Deadline
If deployment is quick, reliable, and straightforward, the "last mile" crunch of release day is minimized [4, p. 2]. This reduces the incentive to rush or introduce technical debt simply to meet a deployment deadline.

### Schedule pressure
An easy and reliable deployment process significantly reduces the risk and time spent on releases [4, p. 2], directly alleviating end-of-cycle schedule pressure and the need to cut corners.
