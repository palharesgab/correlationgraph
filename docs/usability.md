# Usability or Usefulness Support for Tools or Techniques or APIs

### Lack of knowledge about technology
When tools, techniques, and APIs are Developer-centered and well-documented, they lower the barrier to entry for developers and to enhance developer's productivity [1, p. 24]. This reduces the likelihood of developers making mistakes or implementing suboptimal solutions due to a lack of understanding [1, p. 24]. Good usability and usefulness facilitate learning and proper application of technology, directly mitigating technical debt arising from insufficient knowledge.

### Lack of experience
User-friendly tools, techniques, and APIs reduce the required maturity for less experienced developers, making it easier for them to perform tasks correctly and efficiently without needing deep expertise [1, p. 31].
